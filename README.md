A happy collection of tools that I use for game dev in the amazing Löve 2D game
engine. This collection is a work in progress and will be updated as I go along
in my game dev journey. I hope you find something useful here. Enjoy! ♥

#### About

released or held down. The library doesn't use the `love.keypressed` and
`love.keyreleased` callbacks, so you can have control over the input.

The library has finished the development currently, so the only updates that are
planed are, bug fixes or Love 2D updates
