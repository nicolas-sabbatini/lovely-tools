A happy collection of tools that I use for game dev in the amazing Löve 2D game
engine. This collection is a work in progress and will be updated as I go along

#### About

A simple keyboard library for the Löve 2D game engine that can be used to check
the state of a key (just pressed, just released or held down). The library
doesn't use the `love.keypressed` and `love.keyreleased` callbacks, so you can
have control over the input.

planed are, bug fixes or Love 2D updates
